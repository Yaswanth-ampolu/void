# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completing the comprehensive rebranding of the Void IDE code editor to PinnacleAI naming conventions. The project involves systematically updating all references, identifiers, file names, and branding elements from "void" to "pinnacleai" throughout the codebase while maintaining full functionality and consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the PinnacleAI codebase, I want all service class names and identifiers to use PinnacleAI naming conventions, so that the codebase maintains consistent branding and naming throughout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining service classes THEN all class names SHALL use "PinnacleAI" prefix instead of "Void"
2. WHEN reviewing service IDs THEN all static ID properties SHALL use "pinnacleai" namespace instead of "void"
3. WHEN checking service brand properties THEN all _serviceBrand references SHALL use pinnacleai naming
4. WHEN looking at constructor dependencies THEN all injected services SHALL use IPinnacleAI* interface naming

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all file imports and module references to use consistent PinnacleAI naming, so that the module structure is coherent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining import statements THEN all service imports SHALL reference IPinnacleAI* interfaces
2. WHEN reviewing file paths in imports THEN all internal module references SHALL use pinnacleai folder structure
3. WHEN checking decorator usage THEN all @IPinnacleAI* decorators SHALL be consistently named
4. WHEN looking at URI schemes THEN all custom URI schemes SHALL use "pinnacleai" instead of "void"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with configuration and settings, I want all configuration keys and file references to use PinnacleAI naming, so that settings and configuration remain consistent with the rebrand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining configuration files THEN all .pinnacleairules references SHALL be used instead of .voidrules
2. WHEN reviewing storage keys THEN all storage identifiers SHALL use "pinnacleai" prefix
3. WHEN checking action IDs THEN all command identifiers SHALL use PINNACLEAI_ prefix
4. WHEN looking at menu contributions THEN all menu IDs SHALL use pinnacleai namespace

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the UI and user-facing elements, I want all user-visible text and identifiers to reflect PinnacleAI branding, so that users see consistent branding throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users see localized strings THEN all text SHALL reference "PinnacleAI" instead of "Void"
2. WHEN examining editor input names THEN all display names SHALL use "PinnacleAI" branding
3. WHEN reviewing tooltips and labels THEN all user-facing text SHALL be consistently branded
4. WHEN checking icon and theme references THEN all custom identifiers SHALL use pinnacleai naming

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want all internal constants, enums, and type definitions to use PinnacleAI naming conventions, so that the codebase maintains internal consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining type definitions THEN all custom types SHALL use PinnacleAI naming where applicable
2. WHEN reviewing constant declarations THEN all internal constants SHALL use PINNACLEAI_ prefix
3. WHEN checking interface definitions THEN all service interfaces SHALL use IPinnacleAI* naming
4. WHEN looking at enum values THEN all custom enums SHALL use consistent pinnacleai naming

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with the build and deployment system, I want all build-related configurations and scripts to reflect PinnacleAI naming, so that the build process is consistent with the rebrand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json files THEN all package names and identifiers SHALL use pinnacleai naming
2. WHEN reviewing build scripts THEN all output directories and build targets SHALL use pinnacleai naming
3. WHEN checking configuration files THEN all build-related settings SHALL be consistently named
4. WHEN looking at deployment scripts THEN all deployment identifiers SHALL use pinnacleai conventions
